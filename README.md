# Twisted-Bilayer-Graphene
Here I will upload my mathematica note books where I plot my twisted bilayer graphen properties. I will also provide the reference of the article where reader can get help to use these plots.
This is one of them
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02482.pdf, Faithful Tight-binding Models and Fragile Topology of Magic-angle Bilayer Graphene.
There will be many more including some standard one as well.
